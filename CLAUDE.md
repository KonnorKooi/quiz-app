# Quiz App - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
A web-based quiz application that supports multiple quiz types (regular multiple-choice and code pattern quizzes) with interactive features including confetti celebrations, quiz caching, and automatic question randomization.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **UI Libraries**:
  - React (for geological quizzes)
  - Canvas-confetti for celebrations
  - KaTeX for math rendering
  - Markdown-it for rich text formatting
- **Backend**: PHP for quiz caching/storage
- **Storage**: Server-side storage via PHP API

## Key Features

### Quiz Types
1. **Regular Quiz**: Multiple-choice questions with auto-randomized order
2. **Code Pattern Quiz**: Fill-in-the-blank coding challenges with similarity scoring
3. **Geological Quizzes**: Interactive timeline-based quizzes (preset)

### Core Functionality
- **Auto-randomization**: Questions automatically randomized on each quiz start
- **Answer randomization**: Optional randomization of answer choices (correct answer always starts at index 0 in JSON)
- **Quiz caching**: Recent quizzes stored server-side with duplicate detection
- **Question navigation**: Jump between visited questions via dropdown
- **Progress tracking**: Visual indicators for current question and score
- **Quiz review**: Detailed review showing correct/incorrect answers after completion
- **Confetti celebrations**: Triggered on correct answers (configurable intensity)
- **Math support**: KaTeX rendering for mathematical expressions
- **Markdown support**: Full markdown formatting including code blocks

### JSON Format

#### Regular Quiz
```json
{
  "title": "Sample Quiz",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the integral of $2x$?",
      "options": [
        "$x^2 + C$",
        "$2x^2$",
        "$x + C$",
        "$2$"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

**Important**:
- The correct answer should **always** be at index 0 in the options array
- This allows AI to generate better distractors without bias toward longer/more detailed answers
- The app will automatically randomize answer order if the user enables that option

#### Code Pattern Quiz
```json
{
  "title": "Design Patterns Quiz",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Complete the Observer Pattern's update method:",
      "patternName": "Observer Pattern",
      "codeContext": "public class MessageProcessorObserver implements Observer {..}",
      "missingCode": {
        "beforePrompt": "public void update(Observable observable) {",
        "solution": "MessageProcessor messageProcessor = (MessageProcessor)observable;",
        "afterPrompt": "}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## AI Quiz Generation Guidance

When generating quizzes for this app, follow these guidelines:

1. **Answer Ordering**: Place the correct answer first (index 0) in the options array. The app will randomize the order when displayed.

2. **Answer Length Consistency**: Make all options approximately the same length. A common tell for correct answers is excessive detail.

3. **Question Quality**: Ask complex, thoughtful questions that test understanding, not just memorization.

4. **Math Rendering**: Use KaTeX syntax for mathematical expressions:
   - Inline math: `$expression$`
   - Block math: `$$expression$$`
   - Example: `$\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x$`

5. **Markdown Formatting**: Use markdown for better formatting:
   - Code blocks: ` ```language\ncode\n``` `
   - Bold: `**text**`
   - Italic: `*text*`
   - Lists, links, etc.

### Example AI Prompt for Quiz Generation
```
Create a quiz following this JSON format. Note that:
- Multiple choice questions should have the correct answer first (index 0)
- The app will randomize the order later
- Make all answer options similar in length (avoid length bias)
- Ask good, complex questions that test deep understanding
- Use KaTeX for math: $expression$ (inline) or $$expression$$ (block)
- Use markdown for formatting: **bold**, *italic*, code blocks, etc.

Follow this JSON format: [paste the regular quiz JSON example]

## Development Notes

### Randomization Logic
- Question randomization: Uses Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm (script.js:59)
- Happens automatically on quiz start
- Original question order preserved for reference

### Confetti System
- Triggered on correct answers (script.js:175)
- Also triggered on high similarity scores for code quizzes (≥90%)
- Configurable intensity: low, medium, high, extreme
- Emits from sides or falls down (not from center)

### Quiz Caching
- Quizzes cached server-side via PHP API (script.js:825)
- Includes duplicate detection based on quiz content
- Recent quizzes displayed on start screen (up to 10)
- Cache duration: 60 days

### Question Navigation
- Users can only navigate to previously visited questions
- Prevents skipping ahead without answering
- Answers preserved when navigating back
- Implemented via dropdown in quiz header (script.js:549)

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Requires JavaScript enabled
- Canvas API support needed for confetti
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Future Enhancements
- Export quiz results as PDF
- Timer mode for timed quizzes
- Leaderboard system
- Quiz categories and tagging
- Import quizzes from various formats
- Spaced repetition mode
